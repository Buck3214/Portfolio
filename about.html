        <h3>How I got into programming</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Through friends, I learned about a program that paid 250 dollars, and without hesitating, I took the offer.
          Later, I learned that it was a programming course, which at the time I defined as “nerd stuff”. Once there,
          The instructors gave a brief introduction of themselves and explained what coding is. Again, I learned
          something new; this course specifically focused on front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After
          the first day, I was bewildered by the amount of information that was programming. Getting home, I immediately
          made my first website that featured a yellow background, a title, and bullet points filled with memes and
          pictures of my friends. </p>
